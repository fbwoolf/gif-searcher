# GIF-Searcher

Let's search for some GIFs!

## Setup

* Create a database for the app (gif-searcher)
* `npm install`
* `npm start-dev`

The `start-dev` command will run both the `webpack` process (in watch mode) to build your client-side javascript files, and the Node process for your server with `nodemon`.
